# PyBer_Challenge
## Overview of Performed Analysis
V. Isualize approached Omar and myself to perform additional analysis on the ride-sharing data by city type. The data we looked at included a breakdown data from January 2019 through April 2019 as well as overall data included average fares, drivers, and rides based on city type. 
## Results of Analysis
## Summary of Analysis
The outcomes of this analysis suggest that Urban drivers are the most important demographic among PyBers users. While their average fare per drive is the lowest of the city types, they constitute around 68% percent of total PyBer users. Because of this outcome, we have three suggestions:
- If you choose to invest in a particular city type, invest in the Urban market. While it has the most drivers, making small improvements could see greater growth as it performs the most consistently of the city types and is the highest earner. 
- The 2nd suggestion would be to cut down on their Urban drivers. There are currently 59,602 Urban drivers and only 1,625 rides given from January to Apr 2019. Cutting these numbers significantly could reduce an apparent oversaturation of PyBer drivers. 
- Finally, egin to invest more heavily in the Suburban market. They are a larger market than the Rural PyBer commuters and overall, have seen growth from Jan-Apr 2019 with Apr 2019 trending upwards.
