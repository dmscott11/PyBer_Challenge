# PyBer_Challenge
## Overview of Performed Analysis
V. Isualize approached Omar and myself to perform additional analysis on the ride-sharing data by city type. The data we looked at included a breakdown data from January 2019 through April 2019 as well as overall data included average fares, drivers, and rides based on city type. 
## Results of Analysis
### PyBer Summary Table
By taking the data and analysing it using Pandas, we are able to see the breakdown of PyBer rides by city type and identify which are the most profitable, have the most drivers, provide the most rides, and have the highest average fare. It is no surprise that the Urban city category is the most profitable, has the highest drivers, and provides the most rides. Second in those categories would be Suburban PyBer rides with last place going to Rural PyBer rides. When we look at average fare per ride, the inverse order occurs. Rural is the most profitable, with Suburban and Urban falling in 2nd and 3rd. All of this information can be seen in the PyBer Summary Table.

### PyBer Graphical Analysis
Another alternative to the PyBer Summary Table is the multiple line chart shown below. This chart focuses specifically on rides that occurred from January 1st, 2019 to April 28th, 2019. This chart corroborates what the summary table showed us with Urban being the highest grossing city type for PyBer with Suburban and Rural falling 2nd and 3rd.

## Summary of Analysis
The outcomes of this analysis suggest that Urban drivers are the most important demographic among PyBers users. While their average fare per drive is the lowest of the city types, they constitute around 68% percent of total PyBer users. Because of this outcome, we have three suggestions:
- If you choose to invest in a particular city type, invest in the Urban market. While it has the most drivers, making small improvements could see greater growth as it performs the most consistently of the city types and is the highest earner. 
- The 2nd suggestion would be to cut down on PyBers Urban drivers. There are currently 59,602 Urban drivers and only 1,625 rides given from January to Apr 2019. Cutting these numbers significantly could reduce an apparent oversaturation of PyBer drivers. 
- Finally, begin to invest more heavily in the Suburban market. They are a larger market than the Rural PyBer commuters and overall, have seen growth from Jan-Apr 2019 with Apr 2019 trending upwards. These rides also tend to be more lucrative than those in the Urban sector so they could provide a better cash flow overall.
